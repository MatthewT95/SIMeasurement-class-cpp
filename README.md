# SIMeasurement Class

This class provides a datatype for storing and performing operations on measurements that are using SI Units. You can perform all arithmetic operations on the datatype and it will update itself with appropriate SI base units. You can also perform all comparative operations just like any double datatype. It provides the ability to easily generate a string representing the measurement with it appropriate units attached.
