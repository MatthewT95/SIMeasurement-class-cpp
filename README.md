# SIMeasurement Class

This class provides a datatype for storing measurements using SI Units. All arithmetic operations can be performed on the datatype,which will update itself automatically with appropriate combination of SI base units. All comparative operations can be performed like a double datatype. Strings can be easily generated that represent the measurement and its units.
